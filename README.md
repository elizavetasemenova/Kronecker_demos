# Kronecker Demos

This repository provides examples of using the Kronecker trick for 2d Gaussian Processes regression:

- **01**: 2d GP with Normal likelihood
- **02**: 2d GP with Poisson likelihood
- **03**: 2d GP with Poisson likelihood and missing values
- **04**: 3d GP with Poisson likelihood, fixed parameters
